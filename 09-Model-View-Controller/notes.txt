Routing refers to determining how an app responds to a client request to a particular endpoint
aka URI(path) & a specific HTTP request method such as GET or POST.
Each route can have 1 or more handler function, which are executed when the route is matched.

Route definitions take the following structure:
  app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
s.t. 
  app: an instance of express
  METHOD: an HTTP request method in lowercase
  PATH: a path on the server
  HANDLER: the function executed when the route is match
